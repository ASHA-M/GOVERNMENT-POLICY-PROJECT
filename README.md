# How has the sale of Single Use Plastic Bags changed over time in England since the introduction of the mandatory surcharge by the Government? (2016-2021)  

## Purpose of the Project

To investigate if a policy introduced by the government back in 2016 was successful in reducing the sale of single use plastic bags in England.  
To investigate what happens to this money and what types of charities is the money being donated to.  
To investigate the sales of other types of bags (paper, fabric etc.)  

## Key insights and conclusions

The Recycling rate was between 41% - 44% during 2010 to 2020.  
Biggest decrease in single use plastic bag sales was between 2017-18 and 2018-19.  
Supermarkets were the biggest sellers of single use plastic bags.  
Most of the charitable donations went to unknown causes.  
Some companies donated extra on top of the money they made from the sale of single use plastic bags while some deducted large amounts.   

## Data Limitations 

Companies with over 250 employees were only recorded by the government as this law only applies to them.  
Some companies choose not to disclose what good causes they were donating the money to.  
During Covid-19 the government briefly paused the policy for online groccery deliveries.  

## Comments

It would be interesting to look at the data from other parts of the United Kingdom such as Wales as they introduced the single use plastic bag surcharge in 2011.
